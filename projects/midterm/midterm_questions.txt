Comments

<comment>
3
The hash '#' is used right before the text and makes anything after it on the line a comment.
Lists and Tuples
Which is a list
["lemon", "orange"]
{"lemon", "orange"}
("lemon", "orange")
<"lemon", "orange">
1
Square brackets denote a list.
Lists and Tuples
Which is a tuple
["lemon", "orange"]
{"lemon", "orange"}
("lemon", "orange")
<"lemon", "orange">
3
Parenthesis denote a list.
Lists and Tuples
What is the main difference between a list and tuple
Nothing
Lists can be changed, but tuples cannot be
Lists use square brackets, but tuples use parenthesis
List cannot be changed, but tuples can
2
Lists can have new items appended on, but tuples are immutable and cannot be added to.
Data Types
What would be a good data type to store a count of people
Floating Point
String 
Class
Integer
4
Integers are whole numbers and since you can't have part of a person, an integer would be a good choice.
Random
How would a random integer between 0 and 5 be generated with the random library
random.randint(0, 6)
random.randomint(0, 5)
random.random(0, 5)
random.randint(0, 5)
4
The randint function generates a random integer in the range that includes the start and end numbers.
Math
Which statement would increment a variable named x by one in Python
x = x + 1
x + 1
x += 1
1 and 3
4
x = x + 1 would store one plus x back into x, effectivly incrementing it, and answer 3 is justs shorthand for answer 1.

find()
None of the above
2

Calculus

0
cos(x) / 2x * (2/9)x^2 - e * 2 + x
sec(x) * 2x + sec(x) * tan(x) + 2x^2 - 2^x * ln(2) - e^x
sin(x)*cos(x) - x^3 + e^(2 + x) - ln2
3
I really don't want to explain this.
